##Random Walk Simulateion

##<vect.h> is the interface header file and <vect.cpp> is the interface implementation file.

##<randwalk_ver1.cpp> is simulation code

##Compile <vect.cpp> and <randwalk_ver1.cpp> together.

##Through the program in <randwalk_ver2.cpp>, we can see that as the number of trials (number of experiments) increases, the average value converges to the theoretical value according to probability theory: (required number of steps) = (target distance / stride)^2
